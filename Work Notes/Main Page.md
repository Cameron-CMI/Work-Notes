## Leave-off Notes

### Short Term
- continue testing BSB
### Mid Term

- training for BSB - download videos or provide [info/access/links](https://www.microvellum.com/resources/events/intro-to-toolbox-bsb-interface-familiarity-sept-8)
### Long Term

## Meeting Notes
### Bi-weekly Tech Meeting
#### New Business

- take-offs
#### Old Business
- Status of CM FD Mats KB + Obsidian -> 
- AutoCAD NUL renewing 10/27, currently set to not auto-renew. Will verify closer to the date as well. 
- Check-in on equipment updates/Windows 10 deprec.

## Wishlist

### CM FD Mats

- Customized drawer box materials
- Add aliases to the FD Mats in DB
- If they can't fix the data access area, refactor references to G pulled from W

### MV General

- Find space for Product name on Part Label

### Other

## Problems

## Brainstorm
### CNC
- Sensor for mic check out at the machine, some way of comparing true thickness of panel on deck to the thickness it's currently set to in Maestro. Maybe MSL has a function that you can call to check against something outside of the environment...talk to Jake about this one...
### MV
### AutoCAD/BricsCad
- Automated Issue tracking directly connected to DWG files maybe, able to drive a report generation for omnibus RFIs/design meeting agendas
- More purpose-built ACAD templates in general (i.e. one specifically for #7?)

	- Molding take-off+profiles that adds DB elements for PC (report driven instead of using AC Sheets?)
	- Products/Objects that populate the necessary DB objects
- Implement XREF system for stuff where it makes sense. I.e. Finish/Hardware/Equipment schedules, tie it in with workbooks via datasourced tables
- Crestmark standard tool palette and/or dynamic block library

### Process
- Master Naming Conventions guide that captures everything!
- Implement a DMS system (SharePoint via Bluebeam, or Studio or both?) for document control, including revision tracking, design intent notes, un-reviewed changes, spec updates, etc.
- More controlled, engineering-driven field dimensioning for better organization, SSOT, less erroneous/noise information, less judgement-calls and research needing to be done by output engineer (e.g. MAD LIBS-style fill-in-the-blanks based on floor plans, layer-based plot config for creating a dim template). Also some what of standardizing how we create a buildable set of dimensions from varied input sources (i.e. hand-taken dims, scan data, hold-tos).
- Better automation of task management system via linking Outlook w/Monday items in a predetermined way?
- Establish programmatic concept of Design Criteria to help control information flow as we continue to break up tasks more and more, adding/swapping resources around. We need a dependency-based asset and task management that automates parcelization of the specific Design Criteria for specific work, allowing for sub-division and flexible break-up of work while maintaining information integrity, perhaps even driving a dynamic output checklist that ties in with work order tracking, perhaps a Release/WO bundler for automation of tasking, production documents (i.e. data-driven templates), dynamic checklists, modular drawing package logic (i.e. for a WO, only automatically include the necessary drawings/pages)
- Standardized format for parcelization of work, specificities of deliverables, and making sure this is communicated prior to outputting. 2 examples from HDAH (among many) - Jake wasting 2-3 days shaping stringer panels very precisely just to be told to make them long instead to be cut down in field. Conor spending several days to model the plywood backer panels for Mod 73 when the material had already been sent as stock to be cut in the field

### Windows Env
- Scripting file management e.g. putting reports/output files in specific directories, drawings, tie-in with the DMS system + utilitizing the Report Group functionality in MV
- Update file system to correspond better with engineering deliverables and consumables
- Create a clean engineering PC image for easy deployment/redeployment?
### Oddballs
- The DB App project, narrowed down to either estimating only, or focus on building the DB first via automating imports of our standard CTA/Bid forms
- More efficient usage of OpenSpace notes vs. posting on Monday? Automation/linkages between?
